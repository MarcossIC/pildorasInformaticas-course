# Course of "Pildoras Informaticas"
## :rocket: Introduction
Repository that contains the course given by Pildoras informaticas, in which I learned a lot about Java, I upload it to show the content and make it clear where I learned some basic things about Java programming.

This course, unlike the "first course I took", I did it in 20220, and it is done in NetBeans and it is a course in which I help you finish understanding basic things that can sometimes be shocking for a beginner.
